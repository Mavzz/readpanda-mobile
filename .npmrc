# Project-level npm config: force public npm registry for this project
# This prevents using your global/company registry login for installs/publishes here.
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
# don't require auth for the public registry
always-auth=false

# If your company registry used a scope like @company, add an explicit override:
@proximus:registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
# (uncomment the line above if needed)

# === Explicit exclusion templates ===
# Use the lines below to explicitly override or neutralize your company/private
# registry settings for this project. Add the actual scope or host used by your
# company registry and uncomment the matching lines.

# 1) If your company uses a scope (example: @company), force that scope to use
#    the public npm registry instead of the company registry:
# @company:registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/

# 2) If your company registry is hosted at a custom host (example: npm.company.com
#    or registry.company.com), you can neutralize any global auth token by adding
#    an empty token entry here (replace the host below with your registry host):
# //npm.company.com/:_authToken=""
# //registry.company.com/:_authToken=""

# 3) Common example (GitHub Packages) - neutralize project-level auth for that host:
# //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=""

# After making any of the above edits, verify the project registry and auth:
# npm config get registry
# npm whoami || echo "not logged in for this registry"
