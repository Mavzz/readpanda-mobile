ReadPanda is going to be a React Native application where users can read a book. Users can add comments to the parts they like and what not. Once a user reaches that part of the book, the comments become available to otherr users to see. This is something similar to discord where users interact with each other on particualr topic/interest, similarly users on ReadPanda can come togethor as a group and read a book as a group and discuss their thought and comments on certain sections of the book.
Ho to start the app: npm start in terminal
